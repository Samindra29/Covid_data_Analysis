# Covid_data_Analysis (Data Exploration & Visualisation)
COVID has been an integral subject of research for all organisations over the world. 
Let it be for market research to analyse consumer behavior, to observe how products sell online, for medical purposes and many more. 
Due to this reason, a real world dataset excited me to work with it. 

What I did: 
1. Used real life uncleaned data (Dataset Collected from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
2. Explored Data to understand the data set on MySql Workbench
3. Wrote SQL queries for data Visualisation
4. Created a Tableu Dashboard (link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samindra/viz/Covid19_Dashboard_16655876870330/Dashboard1?publish=yes )
